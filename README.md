# Remote computing

This repository contains code in order to create a cheap, disposable supercomputer with R, DigitalOcean, and future. It is based on an idea by [Andrew Heiss](https://www.andrewheiss.com/) which he described in this [blog](https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/2018/07/30/disposable-supercomputer-future/). The original code can be found at [https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/2018/07/30/disposable-supercomputer-future/](https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/2018/07/30/disposable-supercomputer-future/).
